General concept:

Requirements/Goals:
*******************

  -> Multi-Threading with non-blocking interfaces and data swapping
     keeping in mind that the graphics driver is a thread already but
     still the interface to the driver (libGL) may block. Depending on
     the amount of blocking, different data structures may be used.
  -> have a data-oriented interface to the renderer
  -> have data structures working with indices (offset-ptrs) to enable
     usage in shared-memory.
